# BigDataProject
ABSTRACT

According to rapid improvements in genome sequencing, protein functional annotation is turned into the focus of interest in many academic efforts. In this project, we analyze the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB). The TCDB is a comprehensive database for membrane transport proteins, which is approved by the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (IUBMB), known as the Transporter Classification (TC) system. The main goal of this analysis is to cluster membrane transport proteins into families with the same functionality. Supposing sequences with similar features might have similar functionalities, clustering protein sequences based on their features could be a practical method for protein functional annotation.
